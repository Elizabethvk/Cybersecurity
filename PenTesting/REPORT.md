# Pentest Report

### Disclaimer
A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. The findings and recommendations reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.
Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. We prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. We recommend conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

### Purpose
The purpose of this pentest is to find strong and weak points in the security architecture.
